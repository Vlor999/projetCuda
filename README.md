# Assignment 01 of GPU Programming SS 2025

In the root directory you can find a CMake (version 3.16 or newer) script to generate a
build environment. A modern C++ toolchain is required to compile the framework.
## Setup
* Clone repository to directory of your choice
* Create build folder `build`, change to build folder and call `cmake .. -DCC=*`
(replace * with the compute capability of your GPU, e.g. `61`, `75`, `86` etc., alternatively use GUI to setup)
* Build (Visual Studio or `make`)
* Run: `./sc [runs] [num-elements] [seed] [runCPU] [order-preserving] [in-place]`
## Supported toolchains:
* gcc 8.x, 9.x, 10.x depending on your Linux distribution
* Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 on Windows
## Launch parameters:
* ` [runs]` : Number of runs.
* ` [num-elements]` : Number of elements in the input stream.
* ` [seed]` : PRNG seed used to generate the elements.
* ` [runCPU]` : Runs the CPU solution beforehand and compares the results to the GPU solution.
* ` [order-preserv]` : Order-preserving stream compaction.
* ` [in-place]` : In-place stream compaction.


You also need to install the CUDA toolkit on your machine. In order to profile and debug GPU code, we recommend NVIDIA NSight Compute. The exercise requires an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 3.0 (Kepler) or better. If you donâ€™t have a graphics card fulfilling these requirements, contact the lecturer and you will be provided with a card for this term. If you are experiencing build problems, make sure the compiler you are using matches one of the versions recommended above, you have installed the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit version 10.x, 11.x or 12.x and CMake is able to find the corresponding CUDA libraries and headers. You can change the build to different compute capabilities by toggling the CMake options `CCxx` using the CMake GUI, the CMakeCache file, or command line arguments to CMake.

##Bugs
If you encounter any bugs in the framework please do share them with us([Wolfgang Tatzgern](mailto:wolfgang.tatzgern@icg.tugraz.at?subject=[Ass01]%20Bug%20Report)), such that we can adapt the framework.
